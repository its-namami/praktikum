This is my first 1000+ lines of code in one project çš„ project

I feel a sense of accomplishment

//upd 06/04

I've made it even better, now you can use this (not accounting for the menu, i.e. the thing on the top: <header>) on a tablet or a phone, whatever you feel like!

Absolutely crazy how much I've improved this week, I basically learned all of flexbox (with huge gaps of knowledge, of course, which is not something unheared of for a "Niete", which it pains me to say, I am), as well as some basic Javascript (which is, like, absolutely amazing, it enables to do so much more stuff than just raw full on HTML and CSS), and obviously most of HTML needed foer everyday life (which was not difficult at all, unsurprisingly).

Alright, cya!
